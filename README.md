In my final year university thesis, I conducted a comparative study on the accuracy performance of three popular classification algorithms: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Using a selected dataset, the project involved data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of classification accuracy for each method. The aim was to identify which algorithm performed best in terms of 
predictive accuracy, efficiency, and suitability for the given data. The findings provided insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, contributing to better-informed choices in future machine 
learning applications.
